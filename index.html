          What if every new tweet of mine was just taking screenshots of a word document? What if I said there is no boredom quite like the boredom of wanting to die? What if I said I would defend an un-celebration of new years? What if I said “I am concerned with the narrative?” What if I ate myself? What about the Haitian Revolution? What about the immediate reproducibility of the reposting of the reblogging of the retweeting? What if Cotton Mather masturbated? What is my self-portrait in trash? What kind of Accumulation will be the Accumulation we can point to and say “there is the Decadence, there is the Ruination?” What if we brought back the processions of flagellants? What person believes another person who says their favorite director is Fellini? What is an American soul? What is the resting speed of an auctioneer’s voice? What is with these moneyed white girls with liberal arts degrees having the aesthetic of “I can carefully curate my fetishization of poverty?” What is my self without the text? What it the best time of day for throwing up? What kind of shit will I have next? What is my self without my body? What if I changed my name to Antigone? What if I ate that? What would I be like without a name? What kinds of grief can be indexed? What will be the menu of the Last Dinner Party of 2020? What is a president? What is this if not publishing? What’s good?
