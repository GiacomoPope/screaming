      <div class="content">
        Everything is ok. Here everything feels blue and I am breathing air that has been kept just for me. I am calm and weighted. I have become slow and there are notes ringing in my ears that leave spaces for silence. There is a weight that feels like warmth against your eyelids. I breathe deeply and feel bubbles as gaps. You’re kicking away from me. You’re going very fast and you’re beginning to become very small. I reach out with my arms and feel a tear. A sudden wetness across my back that is so cold it feels hard. I reach out with my arms but get pulled backwards. By this point you’re so small I can’t see you anymore.

        I am burying bulbs of glass.<br>
        I am threading lines of copper <br>
        Through snakes from the dirt.<br>
        I am screaming into a horse’s mouth.<br>
        <br>
        I am two hands filling with venom,<br>
        Swollen fingers that fumble <br>
        Teeth deeper into the mud and <br>
        I am sorry for scaring you.<br>
        <br>
        I am buried in water, blisters <br>
        Soft and I tear through <br>
        Bubbling skin. I am forcing <br>
        Wire through bone to keep<br>
        From crumbling to the ground.<br>
        <br>
        I am burying our horse. I am<br>
        Placing holes in the casket to<br>
        Allow for rot. I am looking for <br>
        My teeth in your mouth.<br>
        <br>
        You tell me to leave but my<br>
        Knees are now full of lead.<br>
        I am screaming as you pull <br>
        The snakes from my mouth.
